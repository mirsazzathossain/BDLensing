## Guideline for reviewing a pull request (PR)

1. Go the PR page.
2. Click "Files changed".
3. Check if the PR has changed/added any files that should not have been 
   changed/added. If it does, request to have that corrected. There can be 
   multiple ways within the PR page to request changes, for example, on the 
   main thread on the PR's page, by clicking the text bubble button (**under** 
   the green "Review changes" button), or if it's a .py file, you 
   can click on the "+" symbol at the beginning of a specific line to insert a 
   comment specific to that line.
4. Check if the newly added codes follow good coding practice, for example, 
   PEP8, avoiding redundancies. If not, point those out to be fixed.
5. If you notice some code that can be rewritten to improve efficiency by a 
   significant amount, request to make that improvement.
6. Once you are done viewing a file, click "Viewed" for that file. 
7. Once you are done viewing all the files, click "Review changes", choose 
   between the three options: "Comment", "Approve", "Request changes" as 
   appropriate
8. You are only checking the correctness and appropriateness of the code. 
   You do not need to check goodness of model fit, stylistic elements in 
   the plots, etc.
9. Please don't merge and leave that to @ajshajib.

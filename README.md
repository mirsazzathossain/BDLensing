# BDLensing

This repository stores all the *HST* data, code, and notebooks for the 
BDLensing project.

Once you are assigned a lens system, please do the following:

1. Read [PROJECT.md](https://github.com/ajshajib/BDLensing/blob/main/PROJECT.md)
   and create the 4 GitHub issues described in there.
2. Read [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/ajshajib/BDLensing/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) 
   for instructions on how to fork this repository and provide code updates 
   through pull requests.
3. Create a jupyter notebook in your local clone of the fork inside the  
   directory of the lensing system assigned to you. This notebook is where 
   you will do lens modeling. If you will be running the notebook on Google 
   Colab, you will need to download that notebook time-to-time and sync it  
   with this repo through pull requests.

You are only allowed to modify code files within the repository of your
lensing system. Only .ipynb and .py files are 
allowed to be created by you and added to this repository through pull 
requests. You are not allowed to modify the .h5 files. Make sure your pull 
requests do not add hidden files (e.g., .DS_Store) to the repository.

Use the "Dicussions" section for thie repo to discuss anything or ask 
questions about the lens modeling/analysis being done in this project. 
This repository will be made public after the projet is completed, so 
these discussions will also become public and could be helpful for the 
community to find answers to similar questions they may have on lens 
modeling.
